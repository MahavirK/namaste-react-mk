Namaste React
* Npm init creates the package.json
* Package.json is configuration for npm.it keeps track of what approx version dependency uses
* 2 types of dependencies -  dev dependency and normal dependency 
- Dev Dependency - it is required for development to install it use npm install -D â€¦..
- Normal used in production also
* Package.lock.json keeps track of exact version of the dependency
* Integrity in package.lock.json: it is a hash, to verify whatever is on dev machine its same on production
* Node module is the data base it contains the actual data of the package installed. Node module is collection of packages.
* Package having there own dependency is know as transitive dependency
* No node module in git/production
* Package.json and package-lock.json should be in git/prod
* Just like we have npm we have npx, in npm we install the package and in npx we execute the package
* CDN is not a good way to get react in code, because firstly its a costly operation
* Good way is to have react in node module, i.e. npm install react 
* Parcel Bundle used. Read more https://parceljs.org/
* While building using parcel remove main from package.json as it will conflict with npx parcel build index.html, where index.html is the entry point 
* Running parcel npm parcel index.html {index.html is entry point}
