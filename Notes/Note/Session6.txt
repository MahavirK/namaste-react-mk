* Monolith Architecture :- 
* Microservice Architecture :- 
* Separation of Concerns / Single responsibility principle. 
* React has one of the best render mechanisms.
* UseEffect: 
    * Syntax  - useEffect (()=>{console.log(“UseEffect Called”), []}); 
    * First argument is callback function, Second argument is the dependency array.
    * It will be called once the respective component is rendered successfully.  (Render cycle is finished)
* fetch() is given to us by browsers and not by JS/React. Its super power JS engine has.
* Optional Chaining
* Whenever state variable updates react triggers reconciliation cycle( re-renders component )
