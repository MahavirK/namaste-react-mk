Namaste React
*  To start project write the script in package.json , to run the script write npm run {script name}e.g. npm run start , npm run build
* Note:- npm run start === npm start “start” keyword reserved by npm
* When used root.render, it will “replace” the root element 
* JSX=> is javascript syntax which is easier to write react element
* JSX is not a part of react
* We can write react without JSX, JSX is used because it makes developer life easy 
* JSX is not HTML in javascript , both are different
* JSX is HTML-like or XML-like syntax.
* JSX (code is transpiled before it reaches the JS engine ) - done by PARCEL (not done by parcel)- done by babel (installed by parcel)  
* Babel- JS Compiler / Transpiler, takes JSX and converts into the code that js engine understands
* JSX => Transpiles to React.createElement => ReactElement JS object =>  HTML Element (render) 
* Attributes in JSX are in camel case
* If writing JSX in multiple line in js file write inside ()
* Everything in React is Component
* Two types of Component - 
    * Functional  component - New 
    * Class based component - Old 
* Functional  component is just a normal Javascript function, which return some JSX code. (Always start name it with capital letter)
* A function returning the JSX code is React Component
* Composing two Components into each other is Component Composition
* JSX takes care of injection attacks, JSX sanitises the data in {}. It prevent Cross site scripting attacks
* Functional Component can be called in three ways
    * <Title/>
    * <Title></Title>
    * {Title()}
* JSX can only have one parent element 
* React Fragment :- Behaves like empty tag <React.Fragment> , we can use shorthand <></> empty tags to wrap multiple elements in JSX 
    * It won’t be visible in Browsers element option 
* Can we have Multiple Roots? Can we use React.Fragment in React.Fragment?
